  title: Evaluating Cardiac Electrophysiological Signals
  description: A system for importing electrophysiological signal into R, based on the Waveform Database(WFDB) software package. This package provides a wrapper  for utilizing WFDB functions for reading and writing signal data in R, as  well as functions for visualization and analysis. This package introduces a stable and compatible class for working with signal data, and supports  reading in of specific, electrophysiogical file formats, including  intracardiac electrograms.
